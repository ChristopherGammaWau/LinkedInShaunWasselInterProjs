Course Challenge:
1. Finish the app using FileManager.java and TextBasedInterface.java
Theory: 
1. Implement UIEventHandler interface into a class that calls FileManager methods
2. Instanciate TextBasedInterface in FileApp, add the newly implemented UIEventHandler class as a handler
3. Start TextBasedInterface

Solution:
Yes but FileApp is the one implementing UIEventHandler (I thought FileApp must only contain main())
